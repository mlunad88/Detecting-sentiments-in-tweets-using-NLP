# Detecting-sentiments-in-tweets-using-NLP
## Background Information
According to the WHO, one in every 100 deaths is due to suicide [1]. Today, suicide is one of the main causes of death among young people in Europe.

In addition, social networks, which serve to express ideas, opinions or feelings, also influence this problem. Many young people who have problems use social networks to express their emotions and in some cases self-harming tendencies.
Furthermore, social problems such as the economic crisis or the current health crisis exacerbate this problem [2].

For this reason, some social networks such as Twitter are committed to developing algorithms to detect these trends and feelings, avoiding extreme cases by offering help.
In this regard, artificial intelligence can help since algorithms can be developed to predict these situations.

## Motivation and Objective
The motivation of the project consists in avoiding these tragic events and providing a useful and simple tool to health professionals and emergency services.

The objective of this work is to develop an algorithm capable of predicting emotions and feelings in social networks. In addition, it is intended to quantify these emotions and try to visualize possible patterns.

At its core, this project is a Dash application hosted in a local web server, capable of introducing an existing user on Twitter, obtaining their latest (100-200) tweets and classifying them by emotions. It also features functions to generate word clouds and extract the intensity of each emotion in the corpus of tweets extracted.
